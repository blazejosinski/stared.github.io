# Public projects

My public projects with a certain overrepresentation of data visualizations (easy to share, easy to explain, eye-candy).
More open-source projects on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/stared). For professional work, take a look at [my resume](<(./resume)>).

If you like these, [consider supporting me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/stared/). I will feel appreciated and have more time to polish the existing, and start more.

**What does nudity mean to you?**

For me, nudity is revealing myself as I truly am. It's not some artificial state, but rather the most natural one - without the armor of clothes. This armor protects us from judgment and unwanted attention from others, as well as from nature, like mosquitoes. But when I feel physically and emotionally safe, that armor becomes unnecessary. I can relax and simply be, without needing to separate myself from the world or hide behind a mask.

**Has your approach changed over the years?**

Very much so. Like many of us raised in Poland, I was instilled with the belief that nudity was something wrong. Whenever other people were around, one had to be covered. I don't remember ever seeing my parents naked. All changing in locker rooms had to be done strictly in private cabins.

It came as quite a surprise when I went to a scout camp and discovered there was a communal shower. I quickly realized there was actually nothing strange about it - we'd just quickly rinse off the mud with cold water and that was it.

**And that didn't cause you any difficulties?**

Actually, I was surprised that there was no discomfort. The boys would occasionally crack jokes, but it was all casual. That was my first glimpse that nudity wasn't so scary after all.

**Was it?**

Back then, I would even wear a T-shirt on the beach, only taking it off right before getting into the water. I was self-conscious about my chest, which wasn't just not particularly muscular, but also (in my opinion) - concave.

I started accepting it over a decade later when I heard from a girl that she liked my chest. I remember feeling good about it - a combination of comfort, desire, and surprise. I also understood that tastes vary - and ultimately, it's not about pleasing everyone.

**Did you have any other breakthrough moments?**

Many! One was during my PhD near Barcelona, in Castelldefels. There's a beautiful, long and wide sandy beach where a significant portion of women sunbathe topless. I quickly started treating it as part of the landscape - it's just how things are, how it works.

Another breakthrough came when I went to work in San Francisco, and the startup CEO took us to a Russian sauna, praising it as authentic - including being "clothing optional." The States have a huge range between hippie freedom and puritanism. Sometimes it's more conservative than in Europe, even than in Poland. In some places, you can even end up on a sex offender registry for going somewhere naked - something that would at most get you a fine here.

But back to the story - I like new experiences and was curious about it. I wondered how it would be - my biggest fear was getting an erection. And since my work colleagues were there, I worried it wouldn't just be embarrassment for one evening, but that I wouldn't be able to look over my desk for the next two months. To my surprise, I just felt comfortable and relaxed. And that's where I experienced a proper birch branch massage and discovered what a great experience it is.

**Was it a gender-segregated or mixed sauna?**

Mixed. As it turned out, it didn't matter what gender other people were, or whether they were my type. If our mindset is erotic, a low neckline can be arousing. But here the energy was completely different - people walk around completely naked and it's natural.

**You continued getting comfortable with nudity in saunas.**

In small steps. I went to textile-free evenings at Sante a few times - where nudity was allowed even outside the sauna. I really enjoyed swimming in the pool without anything on. I had previously swum naked in lakes or the sea, but always in places where I was alone and no one was watching.

And now I not only wasn't embarrassed by my own or others' nudity, but it became transparent. Whether someone is dressed or not, conversations look similar. You could even meet new people and talk as if sitting on a couch at a regular house party.

**I assume this was just the beginning of your sauna life.**

Definitely - those were rather sporadic visits, I got really into it much later. During the pandemic, I went through a difficult period after breaking up with my fiancée. I was looking for something that would help me connect with my body, I thought about saunas, but everything was closed. Someone recommended mobile saunas where people do ice swimming. I had been tempted by it for a long time, and now was the opportunity - I took advantage of it, and even dragged a friend along. And that was the only time I went ice swimming in clothes.

We joined a naturist ice swimming group that someone recommended to me. I wondered who would be there - fitness enthusiasts, tough guys, or exhibitionists. At the first meeting, at the Mecca of Warsaw ice swimming, Lake Czerniakowski, it turned out the group was very diverse in age and approach to sports.

**How did passersby react when they saw a group of naked ice swimmers? Did you encounter any negative reactions?**

The spot was by a recreational path where families had their weekend walks. While I was ready for nudity with other ice swimmers, I didn't know how passersby would react. When we undressed and got into the water, I didn't notice any negative reactions - nobody stared oddly, covered their children's eyes, looked for trouble, or wanted to call the police. And that was like "wow". Nudity was present but wasn't fetishized. I think the more nudity is forbidden fruit, the more fetishes form around it - like the shock and excitement when a celebrity's nipple is visible in a photo, or internet users speculating whether someone is wearing underwear under their dress.

**Just a regular attraction...**

Exactly. And here? Well, they just have a body, like any other person.

Once we were ice swimming at Rusałka beach on the Praga side of the Vistula. The only safe way into the water, through a path cut in the ice, was in a place with lots of people a few meters from the shore. Some people had swimsuits and decided to wear them, others (including me) - didn't. We simply undressed and got into the water. Again, complete ease from bystanders. Maybe the world is changing, or maybe it's Warsaw, which is super liberal in many ways compared to many places in the West. Maybe not like Berlin, but from Berlin, it probably can't get any more liberal.

Another situation was when Parostacja Sauna was at the Finnish houses settlement in Jazdów in March, right by the Parliament. People would come out of the sauna in towels or without, and passersby would walk around the place. If they showed interest, it was to ask when they could come to the next event.

**And how did it look when nudity entered your circle of friends? Were you worried about their reactions?**

A few years ago, I got into conducting sauna sessions and for three years, regardless of the season, I organized weekly sauna events for friends. When I get excited about something, I want to share my passion with neophyte enthusiasm.

At first, I worried they'd take me for a pervert who invites people to see them naked. But that wasn't my intention, and I decided I wouldn't censor myself, but rather talk about what I like. Of course, not everyone has to want to use saunas, but I didn't want it to be a secret.

One friend from dance classes had doubts about whether it was just a pretext to see her naked. But I said she could wrap herself in a towel however she wanted and felt comfortable - and she decided to try. When she came and saw how everyone was undressing and talking casually, she joined us. She even ran around naked outside the sauna and said she hadn't felt so good about her body in a long time.

I understood that nudity is very much a matter of context. When we feel safe with it, others perceive it as something normal. If we feel weird about it, others see that too.

And yes, lots of friends have seen me naked and I've seen them too. It's simply become part of everyday life. There are quite a few funny anecdotes from this.

**What kind?**

Most often when we later meet in a different context and I don't recognize someone.
Later I hear "you might not have recognized me, we were dressed differently," which leads to laughter - then I know we met in the sauna.

Another one is when I heard from a friend, "oh, M., it's been so long since I've seen you in clothes!" - to the consternation of people at a dance festival who might not have known the context.

**How do you build the atmosphere during sauna events that you lead? What makes people feel relaxed and comfortable?**

When I lead sauna events, I try to create a friendly, intimate atmosphere where people can open up. Physical openness - being naked - and emotional openness - sharing ourselves without needing to build an artificial image - are two sides of the same coin for me. We feel comfortable enough that we don't need to cover ourselves, either literally or figuratively.

Stripping someone of their clothes is humiliation, but when someone feels safe enough to remove them themselves, that's true revelation. Everything depends on whether it comes from you, your inner self, or is imposed from outside.

In such spaces, there's freedom outside the sauna too - it doesn't matter whether someone wants to be dressed or not. Everyone can decide for themselves what's comfortable for them.

**That's exactly what I appreciated too - that no big deal is made of this nudity. That it's exactly in the context where it should be. It's normal, you can feel at ease, nobody's staring at anyone, it's just comfortable.**

Yes, that's very important. In saunas, nudity should be natural, but unfortunately, that's not always the case. In pool saunas, it varies - people judge, glance sideways. A few times I've heard someone say they "don't like hairy men over fifty," from both women and men. I respond that nobody there has to appeal to you, nobody is there for anyone's show.

**But we naturally see other people...**

In such places, very different people meet - young and old, with different builds, levels of fitness and hairiness, with tattoos and scars or without. And it's beautiful that people are simply themselves.

I remember how one 30-year-old woman was worried about some fold that wasn't quite right, something probably only she could see. And then she sees a 70-year-old woman, with breasts down to her navel, who with genuine joy and naturalness was delighting in her body. The young woman was in complete shock. Something broke through in her, she understood that our bodies don't have to be subject to judgment according to some excessive standards, especially our own. We can simply enjoy them.

I probably don't know a woman who has never had serious complexes about her body. Acceptance is a slow process, and often it's not until their thirties or forties that they feel good about it.

I would be happy if people were more comfortable with their nudity. So that friends could go swimming in a lake in each other's company - diverse people, untouched by Photoshop. Everyone would definitely be more comfortable with their body.

**Can such appreciation be separated from an erotic context?**

I have an anecdote about one friend whom I invited to sauna events, but he refused, saying he only likes nudity in an erotic context. He didn't want to be at an event devoid of sexual context. Until my birthday, where there was also a sauna for those interested. He spontaneously tried it and was then in awe - he felt relaxed, not aroused. It was a shock for him. Suddenly he saw that there's a world where nudity can be natural and non-sexual. It's similar with massages. People who are used to them don't associate them with eroticism.

One of men's common fears is that they'll get aroused - and unfortunately, that's visible from the outside, and might be interpreted as having various intentions. I emphasize that an erection is a physiological reaction, it can even be involuntary. It's not about the erection itself, but what we do with it. Besides, when there's a sauna with ice swimming, I add that you can always get in the water, which will "minimize the problem" instantly - and such reassurance is enough.

**Although you've touched on this topic a few times already, what do you think most strongly determines people's approach to nudity?**

There are two main aspects - cultural and personal.

Culture provides us with patterns, based on prohibitions and commands, but also examples that shape us through osmosis. I'm talking about the approach of family and peers, images in media, customs prevailing in public places like swimming pools. Nobody has to tell us how to behave, we simply observe and imitate. And many of these rules are arbitrary - in our culture, a naked breast is something censored, while calves can be shown without problem. In other cultures, showing calves is an offense.

The personal approach depends on many factors. Primarily on feeling safe, accepting your body, and feeling accepted by others. It's important how comfortable we feel among other people, whether we fear being judged or receiving inappropriate propositions.

**And with all this impression of positive changes, that Warsaw is so progressive, don't you think you've simply found yourself in a bubble that you're in and move around in?**

I surround myself with people who are quite liberal in many ways. But I also mentioned several examples where random people on the Praga beach, not my friends, just walked by and I didn't see anyone staring or pulling others away. Not everyone has to want to join - acceptance means letting others live their lives.

There are activities that are harmful, and it's good that we stigmatize them. But not nudity. Someone might say: "oh, because someone will see a naked body". Well, exactly - and what of it? It's a natural human thing.

What's distorted, in my opinion, is how teenagers learn about naked bodies from pornography. And how advertising construction plaster with large breasts is OK, but breastfeeding in public causes outrage.

**So mainly sauna and ice swimming influenced how your approach to your body and nudity changed?**

Yes, but not only. I've been sleeping naked since long ago, still from high school or university times - because it was more comfortable to be wrapped just in a duvet.

I also developed a lot through a relationship with a girlfriend from a few years ago, thanks to whom I got used to walking around naked at home. She did most household activities in the most comfortable clothing - her own skin. Breakfast for sure, but also cleaning, cooking, or working with documents. Even when she lived on the first floor and I worried someone might see, she said whoever wants to look will look, whoever doesn't, won't. If someone chooses to look and gets outraged - that's their problem that they want to push onto us.

**You mentioned that nudity is natural...**

I like naturalness in many aspects of life, not just nudity. Climbing trees, walking in the forest, sports that don't require equipment - swimming, walking. I also like when people feel at ease, that they don't have to dress up (with clothes, makeup, or behavior), but simply are. They're not pretending anything, they don't want to make this or that impression on anyone.

It reminds me of a quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." In this sense, nudity is perfection to me.

Probably one of the strongest pressures is for women to shave, especially legs, and mandatory under the arms. It's bizarre when in castaway movies women have shaved armpits, despite not having food to eat. And what's unnatural about hair? Hygiene and grooming mean washing, and what hairstyles we have here and there should be our unpressured preference. With naturalness as the default option.

**We've mentioned several times together how difficult a path and many obstacles women have on their way to becoming comfortable with nudity. However, little is said publicly about the difficulties and requirements placed on men in this field. Also, after this project, it's clearly visible how few men decide to participate in it independently. How do you see this from the male side?**

Requirements regarding women's appearance are much greater and instilled from childhood. A man will take a shower, shave, put on something that fits reasonably well, and that's considered OK. At least currently - because in the Enlightenment, a gentleman in the salon had a wig, powder, and wore heels.

Broadly understood beauty standards are, to a large extent, a cultural construct.
On one hand, it's harder these days - because the competition is not just with flesh-and-blood beauties, but with an ideal unattainable without Photoshop or AI. On the other hand, we have the body positivity movement with the message that it's worth taking care of your body for ourselves, not for show.

Women fought and are fighting for the most basic civil rights, self-determination, and personal freedom - including clothing. It's a broad topic, but even in the Western world, state law distinguishes between a legal male nipple and an illegal female one.

However, men, as a social group, slept through this revolution. They didn't fight because they didn't have to, and they're behind. A woman can now wear skirts or pants. For men, it's pants and only pants. Already as a preschooler, this seemed absurd to me, and well. I sometimes wear a skirt, at dance festivals, or even in the city. I do it primarily because it's comfortable, but also because I can - at least in the bubble. But such social changes come from bubbles, and nobody will do it for us.

I have a very strong view that apart from themed events with an assumed dress code, permissible clothing (or level of body exposure) should not have double standards.

**But we're not talking about clothing here...**

Men also have their complexes and fears, which are rarely addressed. Society imposes a very narrow image of the "ideal man" on them, who must be strong, muscular, always confident, with stoic calm. As if the only "real man" was a Spartan or Viking, and there weren't monks and poets in history.

This also affects the approach to nudity. It seems to me that many men are afraid they don't meet these standards and therefore are reluctant to participate in projects involving nudity. There's also, in my opinion, a strongly internalized belief that women are beautiful, and men, well, as they say, "should be slightly prettier than the devil."

The problem here isn't just the taboo of male nudity, but (probably even more so) the taboo of male self-development and self-acceptance.

**This seems to be a deeper problem**

Women often struggle with body complexes, but at least they're aware of it and work on it. Men, on the other hand, often treat their body purely functionally - it should work, and if it doesn't work, fix it and move on. They don't acknowledge emotions, because what if something explodes there. Such physical-emotional walling off.

Many more women than men sign up for massages, therapy, or development workshops. I think many men would benefit from such experiences. The fact that we're disconnected from our body doesn't mean it doesn't exist. On the contrary, health problems caused by neglect appear later.

**But it seems that men have much less problem with nudity in the sauna world, on beaches, and yet the problem must lie somewhere.**

Also from my observation, men often have fewer problems with nudity in saunas or on the beach, but it's completely different with touch. Sometimes I hear from new people that something was a breakthrough. From women (as I mentioned), it's usually about nudity. For men - touch, and especially - from another man.

I remember once when I was massaging someone and asked if someone could do a back scrub for me. He agreed, but with fear and uncertainty, and massaged as if a cat was petting a parrot. Later he said he had never massaged a man in his life.

**What influenced how you now view publicizing your own nudity?**

Once I saw a friend who posted a naturist photo on Facebook. Such a happy, natural, safe, blissful one. I thought that for a woman it's brave, but acceptable - at least at a certain age or with certain attractiveness. For a man, there are two possibilities - either he'll be considered ugly or a "creep," or, if he's attractive, a narcissist.

But I decided not to worry about it, not to nurture internalized double standards. If we don't fight against the norms that limit us, nobody will do it for us. I posted a photo where I'm lying in a hammock outside, and there's snow around. The second photo was from ice swimming, where I cover intimate places with my hands. I wrote a post about nudity and it met with a huge positive reaction. People admired that I had the courage to post it. I also had one reaction where someone felt weird, but a few months later they said thank you because it processed something for them.

It's worth promoting that naturalness is beautiful, regardless of gender.

**What made you decide to participate in the Mornings?**

I heard about the project from N., who was delighted with how natural she felt during the session. When I read the interviews and looked at the photos, what caught my attention was that people are simply being themselves. They're doing something, but not deliberately exposing their body, nudity is part of naturalness. And they share their story, sometimes strongly resonating with my experience, sometimes - very different. As you can see, I also have some thoughts to share, I wanted to contribute, also to promote naturalness.

And well, it simply sounded like an interesting project by someone with passion, and I like such things.

**And how was it?**

Very nice, comfortable, and safe. While during the waking up scene I was aware of being in front of the lens, later, somehow I didn't worry about it. I can't wait to see the photos.
